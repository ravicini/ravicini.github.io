# About

Welcome to my blog. Here I share my thoughts and experiences on software engineering topics related to surviving in the chaotic waters of today's world. I hope you find it useful and engaging.

You'll find articles on software development, software architecture, software craftsmanship, and sociotechnical systems. As I am currently in the process of study Master of Business Administration at FHNW, I will try to combine the technical and the business perspective in my articles.

## About Me

Marco Ravicini is a software craftsperson with experience in several environments and with various types of software, including sociotechnical systems. In these environments, he acted as a developer, a Scrum Master, and a software architect. Besides my consulting work at bbv, I'm CTO of bbv Software Services AG.
